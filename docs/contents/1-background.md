Background, Requirements, and Opportunity
=========================================

Background and Opportunity
--------------------------

Each semester,
we need to plan on which courses to register.
This process is very cumbersome,
because we need to find the list of all the subjects to register,
then find the timetable for each of the sections that we can enroll,
not to mention that when finding the timetable,
we had to know the subject ID;
we can't search by the subject name.

After gathering all the raw data,
we have to plan the courses
by drawing a timetable ourselves,
in order to come up with a schedule
that does not have overlapping class times.

Some other times,
the schedule of some courses are changed,
and the students need to update their timetables again.

This opens an opportunity for us to create a solution
for this problemâ€”a study scheduling tool that will help alleviate all these problems
and can be used by other people.
